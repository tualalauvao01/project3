		<h4>About.</h4>

							<p>The function of this gadget is to block out the spies that watch us through our laptop cameras. I have seen plenty of university students who have sticky tape covering their cameras which led to this idea of having something to replace the sticky tape. The puropose is simple and has been mentioned- it is to block out those sneaky hacker spies who enjoy creepily watching you without your knowledge.</p>
							<p>The aim with this product is to keep those nasty spies from secretly, and creepily, watching you while you do your school work, watch your movies, or whatever you choose to do on your laptop.</p>

                        <p>The reason for having the option to reveal your camera is for those who take video calls, whether that be business or family. This makes it easier for the user as they don't have to rip off a piece of sticky tape and put it back on after it has lost its "stickiness".</p>

                        <p>Blockout is a handy gadget that will allow you to enjoy your privacy. Say goodbye to the sticky tape that you have to constantly replace when it has lost its stickiness and say hello to a gadget that will come to be useful for you. Blockout can help you fight the fear of spies, or the government, watching you. For you university students who are super sceptical about spies, this Blockout gadget is for you!</p>
